## Business Insights and Recommendations
### Recommendations
1. **Target Male Shoppers**
   - Since male customers contribute significantly to Black Friday sales and spend more per transaction on average, Walmart should tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to further incentivize higher spending among male shoppers.

2. **Focus on 26 - 45 Age Group**
   - Given that customers aged 26-45 account for the majority of sales, Walmart should focus on catering specifically to the preferences and needs of this demographic by offering exclusive deals and products.

3. **Engage Younger Shoppers**
   - Customers aged 0-17 show the lowest spending per transaction. Walmart can increase their spending by offering attractive discounts, coupons, or rewards programs to build brand loyalty early on.

4. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Customers in the 18-25, 26-35, and 46-50 age groups exhibit similar buying behaviors, as do those in the 36-45 and 55+ age groups. Walmart can optimize product selection and pricing strategies accordingly.

5. **Enhance the 51 - 55 Age Group Shopping Experience**
   - Customers aged 51-55 have the highest spending per transaction. Walmart can enhance their shopping experience with exclusive pre-sale access, special discounts, personalized recommendations, and loyalty programs.

6. **Post-Black Friday Engagement**
   - To foster customer retention and encourage repeat business, Walmart should engage with customers post-Black Friday through follow-up emails, related product offers, and personalized promotions.
